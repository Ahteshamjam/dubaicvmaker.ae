                    <p class="sub-hero-refund-policy-main-box-description">Occasionally, technical glitches may occur

                        service team immediately with two proofs of receipt for a full refund of the additional charge.
                        In most cases, the problem lies with the clearing company and customers are encouraged to
                        resolve the issue with that company to avoid double deductions in the future.</p>

                        any specific performance as it is entirely dependent on the student's overall performance during

                        has provided adequate learning material relevant to the work entrusted to us. Requests for
                        refunds will not be considered if work is confirmed and received by the client after the
                        deadline has passed. Please note that no refund claim will be made if the Customer does not
                        follow the proper claim process as directed by the Customer
